# doc-writer-mcp

Docementation writer MCP

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was generated with [`kmcp`](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kmcp).

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (1.23 or later)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Local Development

1.  **Tidy dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

2.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    go run cmd/server/main.go
    ```

### Building the Docker Image

To build a Docker image for this project, run:

```bash
kmcp build
```

This will create an image named `doc-writer-mcp:latest`.

### Deploying to Kubernetes

To deploy the MCP server to Kubernetes, first ensure you have a running cluster and `kubectl` is configured. Then, run:

```bash
kmcp deploy mcp
```

This will create an `MCPServer` custom resource in the `default` namespace.

## 🛠️ Adding a New Tool

To add a new tool to your project, use the `kmcp add-tool` command:

```bash
kmcp add-tool <tool-name>
```

This will generate a new Go file in the `internal/tools/` directory with a template for your new tool. You will need to add the new tool to the `main.go` file.
